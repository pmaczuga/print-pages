# silly-double-sided-print
Simple script used to get pages when manually printing double-sided. 

Useful when for some reason double-sided printing was not available in printing options and someone is too lazy to find a solution (like I was).

Unfortunately requires flipping all pages before inserting them to printer again. So only useful when there are not so many of them.
